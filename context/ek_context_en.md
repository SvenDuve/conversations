# Products of Express Kabel GmbH

We distribute a wide range of cables for various industries, with a focus on the automotive sector. We mainly offer FLRY Cables, High Voltage Automotive Cables, and Automotive Data Cables. Our products are known for their high quality, durability, and reliability, making them ideal for demanding applications in the automotive industry.

## FLRY Cables

FLRY cables are special types of electrical cables primarily used in the automotive industry. The acronym "FLRY" stands for a specific set of characteristics these cables have:

* F: Stands for "Fahrzeug" (vehicle), indicating that these cable types are primarily designed for vehicle applications.
* L: Represents "Leitung" (cable).
* R: Stands for "Reduced," referring to the reduced diameter of the cable, achieved by minimizing the conductor cross-section without compromising electrical performance.
* Y: Refers to the type of insulation, which is made of PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride). This insulation is typically thin to minimize the overall diameter of the cable while still providing good protection against the harsh conditions vehicle cables are subjected to.

In summary, FLRY cables are thin, PVC-insulated cables used in vehicles for various electrical applications, designed to be space-saving while providing necessary protection and conductivity in the automotive environment.

## High Voltage Automotive Cables

A high-voltage automotive cable refers to an electrical cable or wire specifically designed for transmitting high voltage (typically above 60 volts DC or 30 volts AC) in vehicles. These cables are crucial components in electrified vehicles, such as hybrids and electric cars, where they are used to transfer electrical energy between various components like the battery, electric motor, charger, and other high-voltage components.

## Automotive Data Cables

Automotive data cables are special types of cables developed for data and signal transmission in vehicles. These cables play a key role in connecting and communicating between various components and systems in modern vehicles, such as infotainment systems, driver assistance systems, engine controls, and other electronic devices.

LEONI Dacar® refers to a specific range of data and coaxial cables developed and manufactured by LEONI for use in the automotive industry. These cables provide solutions for data and signal transmission in vehicles.
